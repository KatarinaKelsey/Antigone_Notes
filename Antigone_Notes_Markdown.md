I’ll show you in red

  It was, I think, necessary to alter the sacred wording here 
 
![The figure shows a woman's mouth, slightly open. Image is monochrome, with ochre tint. Image's right corners are cropped.](images/02-03-img.png)

Hence, as already touched upon in the notes on Oedipus, the dia-  
logic form and the chorus as its antithesis, hence also the dangerous  
form in the scenes, which, in a way more characteristic of the Greeks,  
has a necessarily factive outcome in this sense that the word becomes  
more mediatedly factive and seizes rather the body's senses; but in  
our times and according to our conception of things, it becomes  
more immediate and seizes rather the body's spirit. The language  
of tragedy for the Greeks is lethally factive, because the body it  
seizes hold of does literally kill. For us, standing as we do under a  
You dye your words with red You seem to colour a red word You seem to dy-  
e a red word They seem to dye a red work They seem to colour a red word  
They seem to colour a red word.  

  whereas our chief striving in the  
way our times see things is to hit upon something, to have a fate,  
because having no fate, being _dysmoron_, is our weakness  

  It was, I
think, necessary to alter the sacred wording here but most of all  
tragedy consists in factive words that, more a context than an  
utterance, move in the manner of Fate from the beginning to the end;  
What is it? ~~They seem to colour a red word you seem to colour a Red Word?~~  

![The figure shows a collage of two images depicting at the bottom half the original scan(images/01-03-img.png) of woman's mouth, slightly open, and at the top part the original scan (images/01-11-img.png) of a woman seen from the side, squatting, with dress hanging behind and reaching the woman's mouth below. A horizontal line divides the two images/collaged together, breaking the composition at one third from the bottom. Image is monochrome, with ochre tint.](images/02-08-img.png)

The tragically moderate weariness of the times, whose object is  
of no real interest to the heart, follows the pull of the spirit of the  
times without the least moderation and this spirit appears then as  
something wild and not, like a ghost in daylight, sparing man at  
all, but quite pitiless, as the spirit of the always alive unwritten  
wilderness and the world of the dead. right Rightly right. The real  
language of Sophocles, whereas Aeschylus and Euripides are better  
able to objectify suffering and anger but less the mind of a man going  
on its way under the unthinkable.	but most of all  
tragedy consists in factive words that, more a context than an  
utterance, move in the manner of Fate from the beginning to end;  
It was, I think, necessary to alter the sacred wording here

So weit ist sie entfernt, von zwei <br> erstorbenen Sprachen die taube <br> Gleichung zu sein, daß gerade <br> unter allen Formen ihr als <br> Eigenstes es zufällt, auf jene <br> Nachreife des fremden Wortes,<br> auf die Wehen des eigenen zu <br> merken. | So if you translate Wehen by <br> “birth pangs,” you would have to <br> translate it by “death pangs” as <br> much as by “birth pangs,” and <br> the stress is perhaps mre on <br> death than on life. |
