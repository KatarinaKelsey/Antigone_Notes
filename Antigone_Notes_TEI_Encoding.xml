						<note ref="#KK_contribution">The book was made in response to AMbruno’s 2015 Red project. In Holderlin’s translation of Antigone he employs literal translation: Antigone seems to ‘colour a red word’ where she usually signals ominous news. It breaks and expands the possibilities of the word, exposes red to all its readings, exposes when ‘words once wore the strident colours of their intent’1. I wanted to explore this translation process materially, to explore the word red in this story, not just in its abstraction and obscurity, but its slow energy as it is realised throughout the book, with transfer printing, heavily waxed and flaking paper and silicone. I used literal translation, google translate, friends’ interpretations, texts on translation, images of Antigones and more traditional translation methods. My own practice still follows similar patterns, focussing heavily on research and readings, often resulting in fragmented contents. Material choices are very important in the research process and I consider these equal to the textual and visual content of the book. I prefer to combine the content with more traditional and simple binding structures in the hope that a stable background will allow the content to be pushed to its extreme.</note>
