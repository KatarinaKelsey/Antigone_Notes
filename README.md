This is the digital edition of the artist book Antigone notes by Katarina Kelsey.

The repository contains a TEI encoding of the text, a folder with the original images used in the making of the printed edition, and a folder with complimentary descriptive audio content.

## Book structure and content
The original printed version of this work was made in response to AMBrunoâ€™s 2015 Red project.

It consists of 4 booklets containing:
	
people's versions of Antigone, so how writers viewed Antigone
the theory around Antigone.	
my own kind of interests and experiments in translations	
images of Antigones

The booklets are enclosed in a silicone cover, with a piece of black thread running on the front cover.

The original printed edition of Antigone notes is currently held at Leeds College of Art Library, Tate Library and Chelsea College of Arts.
