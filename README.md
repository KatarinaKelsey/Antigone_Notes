# *Antigone Notes* by Katarina Kelsey

This is the modular open-source digital edition of the artist's book *Antigone Notes* by Katarina Kelsey.  
The repository contains Markdown and TEI encodings of the text, images and complimentary audio content.
The purpose of the repository is to provide access to the content of the artist's book in a machine readable, structured, sustainable and flexible form.
This offers the opportunity for the author and the users of the repository to interact with the artist's book in a programmable way and further experiment, collaborate and publish their own digital editions.
 
The primary source document used to compile the digital edition is the print version of the same work, which was originally made in a limited edition of 15 copies in response to [AMBruno](http://www.ambruno.co.uk/)’s [2015 Red project](http://www.ambruno.co.uk/red.html).
In *Antigone Notes*, Katarina Kelsey takes a single line from Hölderlin’s (1982) controversial translation of Sophocles’ Antigone, and explores the process and the role of translation in conveying the meaning of **red** throughout the story. 
She achieves this by textually interrogating various sources, employing creative translation practices, and materially presenting the results of her research process through transfer prints, heavily waxed and flaking paper and silicone. 

*Antigone Notes* consists of 4 booklets and a loose information sheet, enclosed in a silicone cover, with a piece of black thread impressed on the front cover.
The copies of the original print version of *Antigone Notes* are currently held at [Tate library](http://library.tate.org.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=9ytSNCC4uz/LIBRARY/216580006/9), [Chelsea College of Arts library](https://libsearch.arts.ac.uk/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=354922&query_desc=keyword(s)%3A%20katarina%20kelsey) and [Leeds College of Art library](https://library.leeds-art.ac.uk/liberty/opac/search.do?queryTerm=katarina%20kelsey&mode=BASIC&operator=AND&includeNonPhysicalItems=true&title=Title%20...%20enter%20here&publicationYear=Year%20From&yearTo=Year%20To&catalogAuthors=Author%20...%20enter%20here&mainSubject=Subject%20...%20enter%20here&publisher=Publisher%20...%20enter%20here&series=Series%20...%20enter%20here&limit=All&branch=All&resourceCollection=All&modeRadio=KEYWORD&activeMenuItem=false).
